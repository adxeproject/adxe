axmol-2.0.0 Sep.9 2023

-  Add *experimental* WebAssembly build support(WebGL 2.0) by [@nowasm](https://github.com/nowasm)
    - List of known issues maybe *help wanted*
        - WebGL context lost not handled yet
     - A demo avaiable on axmol gh-pages: [`cpp-tests.html`](https://axmolengine.github.io/axmol/wasm/cpp_tests/cpp_tests.html), build from branch `dev`
     - Note:  Follow functionals require wasm pthread support, and needs server enable https://web.dev/coop-coep/ response with specified header, and by default thread support was enabled by axmol client build commands
         - AudioEngine
         - ASTC multi-thread software decoder
         - `TextureCache::addImageAsync`
         - `MeshRenderer::createAsync`
         -  Extension: live2d not support due to it's sdk core not opensource and not contains wasm prebuilt libs
     - Quick build and run `cpp_tests` on local machine, the command use `emrun` to preview, and it's response with specified headers which wasm pthread support required, so above functionals with multi-threading works well.
         - `axmol run -p wasm -xb "--target,cpp_tests"`
     - Add 2 cmake options: `AX_WASM_THREADS`, `AX_WASM_SHELL_FILE`, refer to [CMakeOptions.md](CMakeOptions.md)
- OpenGL3/GLES3 support, add new cmake option `AX_GLES_PROFILE` to control GLES profile, refer to [#1279](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/issues/1279)
- Mesh instancing draw support
- Use [glslcc](https://github.com/axmolengine/glslcc)(a spriv-corss & glslang wrapper tool) as new shader workflow, write shader by ESSL310, build to target platforms: 
    - MSL for Apple(macOS/iOS/tvOS)
    - ESSL300 for Android, ANGLE
    - GLSL330 for Desktop GL
    - GLSL100 for Android old devices e.g android-4.2
    - Restrict ESSL310 input shader: please only define 1 uniform block at per shader stage
- Improve ProgramManager for loading custom shader program more easy
- Improve text rendering, label SDF outline support
- Improve FileStream, handle large 4GB+ files
- Improve ASTC hardware support detection
- Use ANGLE as default renderer library on win32
- Thirdparty Updates
    - ANGLE: 113.0.5672.128 ==> 115.0.5790.173
    - curl: 8.1.2 ==> 8.2.1
    - fmtlib: 10.0.0 ==> 10.1.0
    - FreeType: 2.13.0 ==> 2.13.2
    - llhttp: 8.1.1 ==> 9.0.1
    - OpenSSL: 3.0.9 ==> 3.0.10
    - webp: 1.3.0 ==> 1.3.1
    - xxHash: 0.8.1 ==> 0.8.2
    - zlib: 1.2.13 ==> 1.3
- API changes:
    - CHANGED: The prototype of [`ProgramManager::registerCustomProgram`](https://axmolengine.github.io/axmol/manual/latest/d1/db2/classax_1_1backend_1_1_program_manager.html#ab0c9fa9f0ebef5f20a868e2ea6cdc631) was changed
    - ADDED: `ProgramManager::loadProgram`
    - REMOVED: `ProgramManager::getCustomProgram`
    - REMOVED: `CommandBuffer::setLineWidth`
- Many other improvements
  
  
axmol-1.0.1 Sep.8 2023

- [NEW] Add [`install-pwsh.sh`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/dev/install-pwsh.sh) to make installing powershell on `macOS`, `Ubuntu`, `ArchLinux` more easier
- [NEW] **Axmol console next**, now almost powershell (except luabinding generator required python3)
  - The axmol console commands `axmol run`, `axmol deploy` aslo support `winuwp`
  - *The axmol console commands not only used by axmol, it's could be used to build any other project based on cmake build system*, i.e, goto any cmake based project directory, then run command: ```axmol build -p win32 -xb "--target, <your_project_cmake_target>"```
  
- [NEW] `ArchLinux` now official supported by axmol community, means, with 2 steps: 
  1. `install-pwsh.sh`
  2. `pwsh .\setup.ps1`
then you can compile for targets: `linux` and `android` (apk) by commands in your axmol's project root directory
  - `axmol build -p linux` for linux
  - `axmol build -p android -a arm64` for android
- [REFINE] Lock android ndk revision to **r23c**
